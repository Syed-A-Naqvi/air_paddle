# AirPaddle: Vision-Based Interactive Ball Simulation

## Overview
This repository hosts an interactive, computer vision-based Pong-style game. By leveraging real-time hand tracking, you can control a virtual paddle and keep a bouncing ball from falling off the screen. The game combines hand detection techniques from OpenCV/MediaPipe with physics-based simulation to create a dynamic, engaging experience.

## Features
- **Real-Time Hand Detection**: Uses a webcam feed to track and translate hand position.
- **Physics-Based Simulation**: Implements realistic ball bounces using Newtonian mechanics.
- **Platform Control**: Hand movement is mapped to the paddle in the game.
- **Scoring & Difficulty**: Tracks the score and can introduce multiple balls to increase difficulty.
- **Low Latency**: Achieves responsive gameplay with efficient algorithms.

## Technology Stack
- **Python**: Main language for the game logic.
- **OpenCV**: Real-time hand detection and image processing.
- **MediaPipe Hands** (optional): Alternative robust hand detection framework.
- **Pygame or PyOpenGL**: For visualizing the gameplay and handling graphics.

## Installation
1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/interactive-hand-game.git
   cd interactive-hand-game
   ```
2. **Install the dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

> **Note**: A webcam is required for hand tracking.

## Usage
- **Hand in Frame**: Make sure your hand is visible to the webcam.
- **Movement**: Move your hand left or right to position the paddle.
- **Objective**: Prevent the ball from crossing the bottom of the screen.
- **Scoring**: Each successful bounce increments your score.

## How It Works
1. **Hand Tracking**: Computer vision algorithms detect your hand position in each frame.
2. **Mapping**: This position is mapped onto the game’s coordinate system.
3. **Physics Simulation**: The ball follows a physics model, bouncing off walls and the paddle.
4. **Collision Detection**: The game checks for collisions between the ball and paddle or walls.

## Challenges and Solutions
| Challenge                               | Proposed Solutions                                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hand Detection Accuracy**             | Use adaptive thresholding or ML-based models to handle varying lighting |
| **Real-Time Performance Requirements**  | Optimize computations with GPU or efficient libraries (NumPy, OpenCV)   |
| **Complex Collisions**                  | Implement precise collision detection and reflection angles             |

## Future Improvements
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Play cooperatively or competitively with multiple users.
- **Mobile/Tablet Support**: Extend to mobile devices using device cameras.
- **Additional Obstacles**: Add power-ups, traps, or special items to keep gameplay fresh.
